## Problem 3
You're going to want to use a total of 3 stacks. 1 stack has all elements while the other two are empty. In the first empty stack load all of the stack elements in the filled stack by sequentially popping them out into the 1st empty stack. Now the stack will be reversed, but it will not be in the original one. To solve this, do the same process in the first originally empty stack and load it into the second empty stack which will cause it to be in the original order. Lastly, we can load it back into the original stack so then it will be reversed.
## Problem 4
Take a string of parentheses/brackets and splice it into each character. Go by each character and load it into the stack if the bracket is the left version. If the character is a right version, you will want to check to see if the top of the stack has the same type of bracket of the opposite direction. If it doesn't the parenthesis are not matching. If it does, you can pop the top element of the stack until the stack is empty.
## Problem 5
Create an empty queue and take the stack that has all the data and load it into the queue. You're going to want to pop the element from the front of the queue and also push it to the back of the queue so then you're able to have new elements that are duplicates of the original stack. Then you can push both elements to the original stack and to the empty stack for the copy of the stack.
